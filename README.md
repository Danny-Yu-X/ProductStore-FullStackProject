## Overview

### Goal

Users should be able to:

- Interact with the UI by creating products with various inputs such as product name, price, and image, and add products to a homepage
- On the homepage, the user can view products in a unique card-like display, edit, and delete products
- Toggle the webpage from light to dark mode while maintaining color contrast and responsiveness

### What I learned

While working through this project, some of my major learnings were utilizing frontend and backend frameworks to create a responsive, interactive, and styled full-stack application. I learned how to implement a custom API using Express.js for the first time so that the user can send requests and interact with the MongoDB database. It was really interesting to observe how the user's inputs get converted to JSON format and stored in the database. I also learned how to host a server that combines both the front-end user interface (client side) and the database (server side), and see changes in real time!


### Continued development

In future projects, I plan on building more full-stack applications. This was my first full-stack application that I built, and although I ran into several errors while testing, it was really worth it in the end. I also plan on learning more about APIs and the backend aspects of a full-stack application so that I can ensure that the user can successfully interact with the database.
